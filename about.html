<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
I am Mohd Azhar Shaikh, with 11 years of expeience I am a highly versatile and results-driven Lead DevOps and AI/ML Engineer with over 10+ years of hands-on experience in designing, building, and managing scalable, secure, and high-performance cloud infrastructures across Azure, AWS, and GCP. Throughout my career, I have successfully bridged the gap between software development, cloud operations, and machine learning by creating automated, reliable, and intelligent platforms that accelerate innovation.

My expertise lies in architecting cloud-native systems, implementing robust CI/CD pipelines, and enabling seamless deployment workflows using modern DevOps tools such as Kubernetes, OpenShift, Terraform, GitLab CI, and Argo CD. I specialize in building reproducible environments for AI/ML workloads, including GPU-accelerated model training, large-scale inference pipelines, and production-grade monitoring solutions.

I have extensive hands-on experience with machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers, and I actively work on optimizing models using TensorRT and other performance-tuning techniques to ensure low-latency, high-throughput AI systems. I am passionate about transforming complex ML models into real-world, production-ready solutions that deliver measurable business value.

With a strong foundation in observability and monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry, I focus on building highly available and fault-tolerant distributed systems. Troubleshooting complex performance issues, improving system reliability, and ensuring security compliance are key strengths I bring to every project.

Beyond technology, I believe in continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation. I enjoy mentoring teams, automating repetitive processes, and building platforms that empower organizations to move faster with confidence. My goal is to create intelligent, scalable, and resilient infrastructures that drive efficiency and support next-generation AI-driven applications.
